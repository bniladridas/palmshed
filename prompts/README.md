# Image Prompts

A library of image generation prompts for portfolio assets, all following the design system: dark canvas, monochrome, one green accent, Inter/IBM Plex Sans, generous whitespace.

## Index

- `cards.md`: prompts for portfolio card images
- `banner.md`: prompts for the LinkedIn banner
- `avatar.md`: prompts for the profile avatar
- `diagrams.md`: prompts for conceptual article imagery

## Style anchor

Append this to every prompt so results stay consistent:

> Minimal design, dark background (#111110), light grey text (#e6e6e3), one accent color of muted green (#3fb950), Inter or IBM Plex Sans typography, generous whitespace, flat vector illustration, no gradients, no clutter, high contrast, clean line work, quiet and human.

## Negative prompt

> photorealistic, 3D render, glossy, busy, cluttered, more than one accent color, gradients, drop shadows, emoji, text artifacts, watermark.

## Post-process

Generated images need the same treatment every time: export at 2x resolution, confirm the accent is exactly `#3fb950`, and reject anything that introduces a second accent color.
